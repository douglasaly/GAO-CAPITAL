        <h1>The Team</h1>
        <p class="team-page-intro">
          Our team has on average over 12 years of investing experience and has
          been through numerous economic cycles. The team's extensive experience
          in the financial industry gives GAO a deep understanding of the
          markets and specializations across asset classes. Over the years, GAO
          has achieved a resilient, consistent and successful track record on an
          absolute basis, providing clients with investment choices that are
          usually available only to much larger institutions.
